In this assignment you will complete a skeleton code for an ANN. It is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP).
The number of hidden layers is 1 consisting of 16 neurons.

1. Start with loading and visualization of data.
2. As mentioned in the code. The trick is to think in terms of matrices and layer-wise computation instead of neuron-wise.
3. In the test function, write a code to measure the accuracy of your model. Use the sklearn metrics function.
